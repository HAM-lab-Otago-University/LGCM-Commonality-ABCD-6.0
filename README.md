## Cognitive Functioning and Parental Psychopathology in the Development of Adolescent Psychopathology 

### Abstract

#### Objective:

Cognitive functioning and parental psychopathology are established transdiagnostic risk factors for the development of child psychopathology.  But how are these two factors jointly associated with the course of child psychopathology?

#### Method:

We analyzed data from 11,837 youth-caregiver dyads participating in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study. Child psychopathology was assessed annually across seven annual waves (baseline: M = 9.91 years). Cognitive functioning was measured at four timepoints, while parental psychopathology was assessed at three timepoints.

#### Results:

Children with lower cognitive functioning at age 10 exhibited worse psychopathology at that time. However, they showed steeper improvements in psychopathology over the following seven years. Improvements in cognitive functioning were associated with improvements in externalizing symptom severity across development. At age 10, children of parents with worse psychopathology tended to have worse psychopathology themselves and were more likely to experience worsening internalizing psychopathology over time.  Moreover, parents whose psychopathology worsened over time were more likely to have children whose general psychopathology, including internalizing and externalizing psychopathology, also worsened. In terms of variance explained, cognitive functioning accounted for a smaller proportion (0.6–6.2% for intercepts; 1.4–4.6% for trajectories) compared to parental psychopathology (33.8–50.2% for intercepts; 21.9–56% for trajectories) in explaining child psychopathological development. Notably, at age 10, parental psychopathology accounted for the majority (approximately 80%) of the variance attributed to cognitive functioning (5% out of 6.2%) on child psychopathology at that time.

#### Conclusions:

The results revealed prominent roles of parental psychopathology and, to a lesser extent, cognitive functioning on psychopathological development.

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive DevelopmentSM (ABCD) Study (https://abcdstudy.org), held in the NIMH Data Archive (NDA). This is a multisite, longitudinal study designed to recruit more than 10,000 children age 9-10 and follow them over 10 years into early adulthood. The ABCD Study® is supported by the National Institutes of Health and additional federal partners under award numbers U01DA041048, U01DA050989, U01DA051016, U01DA041022, U01DA051018, U01DA051037, U01DA050987, U01DA041174, U01DA041106, U01DA041117, U01DA041028, U01DA041134, U01DA050988, U01DA051039, U01DA041156, U01DA041025, U01DA041120, U01DA051038, U01DA041148, U01DA041093, U01DA041089, U24DA041123, U24DA041147.
